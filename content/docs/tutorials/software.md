*Note, an alternative to the above two steps is to use the ONLINE Arduino IDE at [create.arduino.cc/editor](create.arduino.cc/editor)!*

Next, we need to create you an Arduino Cloud IoT account. It's FREE! 

- First, go to [https://cloud.arduino.cc](https://cloud.arduino.cc)
- Click "get started for free" and "create account" below the sign-in
- Do not enter any credit card information, there is a free plan! The plans can be viewed at [https://cloud.arduino.cc/plans](https://cloud.arduino.cc/plans)

We will be using both the Arduino IDE (online or desktop) as well as the Arduino Cloud platform for the rest of the class! So please let us know if you have issues!
