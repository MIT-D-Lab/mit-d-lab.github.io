Welcomem to the documentation center for the class! This will be your central resource for labs, technical readings, and will also contain great information to share with your partners! Please note that since this website is online, we have limited control on how it displays on various devices. **If you ever need a PDF version, or anything enlarged, please [email Adi!](mailto:adim@mit.edu)**

A secondary note, questions are welcome and encouraged! Please ask your questions to the staff and often we will post clarifications to this site to help other students as well (though we won't name you unless you want us to)! 

## Labs

You will all recieve a **lab kit that you will share with a partner**. Please see the [labs](labs) page for information on the kit.

  Please note, lab content may not be updated until the **date of the lab according to the syllabus!** We will try to get it up ahead of time, but until then please excuse the draft content! Thank you {{< icon "heart" >}}!

## Readings

You will be responsible for completing readings before coming to class and lab! These readings are really helpful to get moving on the lab, so while we won't be checking if you read them, they're really critical to doing well in the class! 

<div class="mt-6"></div>

    title="Reading 1"
    subtitle="Introduction to Electronics, how to not explode everything!"
    link="readings/reading1"
  >}}
  {{< hextra/feature-card
    title="Reading 2"
    subtitle="Example in developing funcational requirements for an IoT system."
    link="readings/reading2"

  {{< hextra/feature-card
    title="Reading 3"
    subtitle="Introduction to sensors, measurement, and filtration."

    subtitle="Introduction to motors, actuators, and mechatronics systems."
    link="readings/reading4"

{{< /cards >}}

<div class="mt-6"></div>

Please also note that the **resources page** was designed exactly to give you more information than what is contained in the readings. Each reading will also have a **references, and further reading section** which is optional but encouraged in case you feel you need to explore more to understand! As always, please reach out with questions!
