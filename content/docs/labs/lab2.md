Lab 2 (sensors and input devices)
- analog vs digital input
- ADCs and the concept of discretiation 
- nyquist and sampling frequency 
- familiarity with various sensors 
- basic moving average filters
- hardware filters such as RC filters and debounce **do a debounce filter!!!**
  - we will also use INTERRTUPTS here!!! 
- I2C, serial, and digital communications sensors
- calculate communications speed for data streamed to the computer or the cloud 


*Also learn to...*
- REMBER BACK TO READING 1 and RATINGS
- CHECK POLARITY AND CONTINUITY
- Read from a sensor and print to serial terminal (printing variables as well)
- Then print to serial plotter

**Calibration and TRUSTING your sensors!!!! --> how to know when you trust your sensor!**
