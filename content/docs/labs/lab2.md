Lab 2 (sensors and input devices)
- analog vs digital input
- ADCs and the concept of discretiation 
- nyquist and sampling frequency 
- familiarity with various sensors 
- basic moving average filters
- hardware filters such as RC filters and debounce **do a debounce filter!!!**
  - we will also use INTERRTUPTS here!!! 
- I2C, serial, and digital communications sensors
- calculate communications speed for data streamed to the computer or the cloud 


*Also learn to...*
- REMBER BACK TO READING 1 and RATINGS
- CHECK POLARITY AND CONTINUITY
- Read from a sensor and print to serial terminal (printing variables as well)
- Then print to serial plotter

**Calibration and TRUSTING your sensors!!!! --> how to know when you trust your sensor!**




### Lab Planning

Essentially THIS [Connecting Sensors](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/mkr-wifi-1010/connecting-sensors/) but with more info.

- Types of GPIOs
  - analog 
  - INPUT PULLUP and PULLDOWN for digital input 
- At least (1x) analog sensor
  - manually reading an analog sensor with a multimeter
  - ADC discretization ( datatypes from AnalogRead() )
- At least (1x) button, an RC de-bounce filter (this IS a digital sensor)
  - this is the debounce circuit - show WITH and WITHOUT
- At least (1x) digital sensor, like an ENCODER, or I2C, or SPI sensor
  - Moving Average Filters (smoothing show WITH and WITHOUT)
- Samping and the Nyquist Frequency
  - How fast *should you read*
  - How fast *can you read*
  - (this is DIFFERENT for Analog and Digital)
- Techniques
  - Using an Analog Sensor with a Digital Input (automated thresholding) ???
  - Hardware filtering for analog sensors 
  - triggering **interrupts** with digital sensors
  - triggering **interrupts** with timers
